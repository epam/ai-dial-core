# DIAL CORE

## Overview

HTTP Proxy provides unified API to different chat completion and embedding models, assistants and applications.
Written in Java 17 and built on top of [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io/).

## Build

Build the project with Gradle and Java 17:

```
./gradlew build
```

## Run

Run the project with Gradle:

```
./gradlew run
```

Or run `com.epam.aidial.core.AIDial` class from your favorite IDE.

## Helm Deployment

You have the option to deploy the AI DIAL Core on the Kubernetes cluster by utilizing an _umbrella_ [dial](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/main/charts/dial/README.md) Helm chart, which also deploys other AI DIAL components. Alternatively, you can use [dial-core](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/main/charts/dial-core/README.md) Helm chart to deploy just Core. 

> Refer to [Examples](https://github.com/epam/ai-dial-helm/blob/main/charts/dial/examples/README.md) for guidelines.

In any case, in your Helm values file, it is necessary to provide application's configurations described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

## Configuration

* [Static settings](#static-settings)
* [Dynamic settings](#dynamic-settings)

### Static settings

Static settings are used on startup and cannot be changed while application is running. Refer to [example](sample/aidial.settings.json) to view the example configuration file. 

Priority order:

1. Environment variables with extra "aidial." prefix. E.g. "aidial.server.port", "aidial.config.files".
2. File specified in "AIDIAL_SETTINGS" environment variable.
3. Default resource file: src/main/resources/aidial.settings.json.

### Storage requirements

AI DIAL Core stores user data in the following storages:
* **Blob Storage** keeps permanent data.
* **Redis** keeps volatile in-memory data for fast access.

### AWS S3 Blob Store

There are two types of credential providers supported:
- User credentials. You can create a service principle and authenticate using its secret from the Azure console.
- Temporary credentials with [IAM roles for service accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html).

#### User credentials

Set `storage.credential` to Secret Access Key  and `storage.identity` -  Access Key ID.

#### Temporary credentials

Follow [instructions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) to setup your pod in AWS EKS.
`storage.credential` and `storage.identity` must be unset.

### Google Cloud Storage

There are two types of credential providers supported:
 - User credentials. You can create a service account and authenticate using its private key obtained from the Developer console.
 - Temporary credentials. Application default credentials (ADC).

#### User credentials

Set `storage.credential` to a path to the private key JSON file and `storage.identity` must be unset. Refer to the example below:

```
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "<your_project_id>",
  "private_key_id": "<your_project_key_id>",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n<your_private_key>\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "gcp-dial-core@<your_project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "<client_id>",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/gcp-dial-core.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}
```
Otherwise, `storage.credential` is a private key in PEM format and `storage.identity` is a client's email address.

#### Temporary credentials

Follow [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/workload-identity) to setup your pod in GKE.
`storage.credential` and `storage.identity` must be unset.
JClouds property `jclouds.oauth.credential-type` should be set to `bearerTokenCredentials`, refer to the below example.

```
{
  "storage": {
    "overrides": {
      "jclouds.oauth.credential-type": "bearerTokenCredentials"
    }
  }
}
```

### Azure Blob Store

There are two types of credential providers supported:
- User credentials. You can create a service principle and authenticate using its secret from the Azure console.
- Temporary credentials with Azure AD Workload Identity.

#### User credentials

Set `storage.credential` to the service principle secret and `storage.identity` - service principle ID.

#### Temporary credentials

Follow [instructions](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/) to setup your pod in Azure k8s.
`storage.credential` and `storage.identity` must be unset.

This example demonstrates the properties to be overridden:

```
{
  "storage": {
    "endpoint": "https://<Azure Blob storage account>.blob.core.windows.net"
    "overrides": {
      "jclouds.azureblob.auth": "azureAd",
      "jclouds.oauth.credential-type": "bearerTokenCredentials"
    }
  }
}
```

### Redis

Redis can be used as a cache with volatile-* eviction policies:
```
maxmemory 4G
maxmemory-policy volatile-lfu
```

> **Note**: Redis will be strictly required in the upcoming releases 0.8+.

### Dynamic settings

Dynamic settings are stored in JSON files, specified via "config.files" static setting, and reloaded at interval,
specified via "config.reload" static setting. Refer to [example](sample/aidial.config.json).

Dynamic settings can include the following parameters:

| Parameter                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
