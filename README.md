# DIAL CORE

## Overview

HTTP Proxy provides unified API to different chat completion and embedding models, assistants and applications.
Written in Java 17 and built on top of [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io/).

## Build

Build the project with Gradle and Java 17:

```
./gradlew build
```

## Run

Run the project with Gradle:

```
./gradlew run
```

Or run com.epam.aidial.core.AIDial class from your favorite IDE.

## Configuration

### Static settings

Static settings are used on startup and cannot be changed while application is running. Priority order:

* Environment variables with extra "aidial." prefix. E.g. "aidial.server.port", "aidial.config.files".
* File specified in "AIDIAL_SETTINGS" environment variable.
* Default resource file: src/main/resources/aidial.settings.json.

### Google Cloud Storage

There are two types of credential providers supported:
 - User credentials. You can create a service account and authenticate using its private key obtained from Developer console
 - Temporary credentials. Application default credentials (ADC)

#### User credentials

You should set `storage.credential` to a path to the private key JSON file and `storage.identity` must be unset.
See example below:
```
{
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "<your_project_id>",
  "private_key_id": "<your_project_key_id>",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n<your_private_key>\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "gcp-dial-core@<your_project_id>.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "client_id": "<client_id>",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/gcp-dial-core.iam.gserviceaccount.com",
  "universe_domain": "googleapis.com"
}
```
Otherwise `storage.credential` is a private key in PEM format and `storage.identity` is a client email address.

#### Temporary credentials

You should follow [instructions](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/workload-identity) to setup your pod in GKE.
`storage.credential` and `storage.identity` must be unset.
JClouds property `jclouds.oauth.credential-type` should be set `bearerTokenCredentials`, e.g.

```
{
  "storage": {
    "overrides": {
      "jclouds.oauth.credential-type": "bearerTokenCredentials"
    }
  }
}
```

### Azure Blob Store

There are two types of credential providers supported:
- User credentials. You can create a service principle and authenticate using its secret from Azure console
- Temporary credentials with Azure AD Workload Identity

#### User credentials

You should set `storage.credential` to service principle secret and `storage.identity` - service principle ID.

#### Temporary credentials

You should follow [instructions](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/) to setup your pod in Azure k8s.
`storage.credential` and `storage.identity` must be unset.

The properties to be overridden are below:

```
{
  "storage": {
    "endpoint": "https://<Azure Blob storage account>.blob.core.windows.net"
    "overrides": {
      "jclouds.azureblob.auth": "azureAd",
      "jclouds.oauth.credential-type": "bearerTokenCredentials"
    }
  }
}
```

### Redis
The Redis can be used as a cache with volatile-* eviction policies:
```
maxmemory 4G
maxmemory-policy volatile-lfu
```

Note: Redis will be strictly required in the upcoming releases 0.8+.

### Dynamic settings

Dynamic settings are stored in JSON files, specified via "config.files" static setting, and reloaded at interval,
specified via "config.reload" static setting.
Dynamic settings include:

* Models
* Assistant
* Applications
* Access Keys
* Access Permissions
* Rate Limits
